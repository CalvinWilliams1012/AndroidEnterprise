# This Repo...
## What is it?
This is an android REST implementation. 

The REST call is sent to an JavaEE sprite implementation that is not included in this repo.

This is a basic implementation with a few glitches as it was rushed so I could help my team 
with there parts as we had quite the dysfunctional team.

## What is it for?
This was my part for my Enterprise Application Programming final group project.
